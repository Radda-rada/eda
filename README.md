# eda
eda for malicious code
The EDA is expected to provide a foundational understanding of the dataset's characteristics, highlight potential indicators of malicious activity, and identify areas for deeper investigation. Specifically, we anticipate uncovering: Patterns or anomalies in traffic volume over time. Common characteristics of connections labeled as "Malicious" and specifically as part of a "Horizontal Port Scan." Correlations between different measurements that could indicate typical or atypical network behaviors. Distribution of protocols and services involved in the observed malicious activities. Conclusion By conducting a thorough EDA on this dataset, we aim to uncover insights into the network traffic patterns and identify characteristics of malicious activities. This analysis serves as a stepping stone for further investigation, including developing predictive models to detect similar activities in real-time. The findings could also inform network security strategies, helping to better defend against identified threats.
